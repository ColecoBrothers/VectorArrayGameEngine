c# Winforms Vector Drawing 2D Library
Simple 2d Vector examples for handing and animating polygons in Winforms. 
Started as a demonstrationsnippet of converting a Windows TTF into a Polygon.
This project evolved in to a timing example of reatime vecor processing. 

Any familiarity to copyrighted works is coincidental. ;)
